# Getting started:

Clone the repository and navigate into it

    git clone https://github.com/California-Planet-Search/KPF-Pipeline.git

Use the provided ``makefile`` for package installation and setup

    make

Now, build the documentation with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)

    cd docs
    make html

Sphinx support various format for documentation (like PDF, LaTeX, etc.). Here
we build the document with html format.

Once the documentation is built, navigate into the `doc\build\html` folder and
open `index.html` in a web browser of your choice.
