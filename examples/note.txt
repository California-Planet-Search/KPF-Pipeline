the following lists recipe/config examples for KPF pipeline, (kpf is run under folder KPF-Pipeline)

the instrument data is stored at ownCloud/KPF-Pipeline-TestData where ownCloud is the folder at the same level of KPF-Pipeline and KeckDRPFramework. 

The recipe and config pairs to perform order trace, optimal extraction, radial velocity for different instruments are listed as below:

- kpf examples/test_neid.recipe  examples/default_neid.cfg => perform order_trace, optimal extraction and radial velocity for NEID on target Tau Ceti
  master recipe: test_neid.recipe
  subrecipes: test_order_trace.recipe, test_optimal_extraction.recipe, test_neid_radial_velocity.recipe
  note: create folder test_results/neid under KPF-Pipeline to contain the results

- kpf examples/test_neid_reweight.recipe  examples/default_neid.cfg => perform radial velocity and reweight ccf orders for NEID on target Tau Ceti
  for NEID on target Tau Ceti
  master recipe: test_neid_reweight.recipe
  subrecipes: test_neid_radial_velocity_reweight.recipe by doing reweighting ccf orders while computing radial velocity or
	      test_neid_radial_velocity_reweight_2.recipe by doing reweighting ccf orders after after radial velocity is complete. 
  note: create folder test_results/neid under KPF-Pipeline to contain the results    

- kpf examples/test_paras.recipe examples/default_paras.cfg =>  perform order_trace and optimal extraction for PARAS
  master recipe: test_paras.recipe
  subrecipes: test_order_trace.recipe, test_optimal_extraction.recipe
  notes: create folder test_results/paras under KPF-Pipeline to hold the results

- kpf examples/test_neid_hd127334.recipe examples/default_neid_hd127334.cfg => perform radial velocity and reweight ccf orders on level 1 data
  for NEID on target H127334.
  master recipe: test_neid_hd127334.recipe
  subrecipe: neid_radial_velocity_hd127334.recipe by doing reweighting ccf orders while computing radial velocity or
             test_neid_radial_velocity_hd127334_2.recipe by doing reweighting ccf orders on level 2 data after radial velocity is complete. 
  note: create folder test_results/neid_hd127334  under KPF-Pipeline to contain the results

- default_recipe_test_neid.cfg and default_recipe_test_paras.cfg are the configuration files used for recipe test,
  tests/regression/test_order_trace_recipe.py, tests/regression/test_optimal_extraction.recipe and tests/regression/test_radial_velocity_recipe.py.
