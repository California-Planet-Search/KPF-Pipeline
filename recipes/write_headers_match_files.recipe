# This recipe measures diagnostic information (e.g., dark current) from KPF objects 
# read from FITS files (2D, L1, L2, Masters), adds that information to the headers of the 
# objects and saves to KPF objects to FITS files.
# Which diagnostic information is set is determined by the config parameters that 
# are traditionally stored in configs/write_headers_match_files.cfg
# This recipe is intended for bulk processing.  After the headers are created with 
# the standard recipe (kpf_dpr.recipe), this recipe will likely only be needed in cases 
# when a new diagnostic test is added and the goal is to add that information to 
# existing files without a full reprocessing.
# 
# This script is executed using the command 
#     > kpf -c configs/write_headers_match_files.cfg -r recipes/write_headers_match_files.recipe
# The header keywords that are written depend on the flags set in the config file.
