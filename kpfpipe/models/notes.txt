Updates: 
1. waves now get their own HDU in fits files
2. no header keywords is store in any HDU that is not the PrimaryHDU
3. HDU are names as '{%fiberName}_{%arrayType}', arrayType can only be 'flux' or 'wave'
4. Level1 requires at least 15 HDU for storage (5 fiber, each with flux, wave and variance)
5. info are identified through KPF header keywords. 

Questions: 
1. write in data format other than KPF? (HARPS, NEID, ...) NO

bring the ones arent mapped into the data as well

store segments in a different file (config?)
segments are identified by wave (start - finish)
segment info included in lvl2
