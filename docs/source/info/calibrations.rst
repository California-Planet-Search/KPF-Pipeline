KPF Calibrations and Master Files
=================================

Calibrations
------------

Main Spectrometer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With rare exceptions, calibration spectra are taken on a daily basis with KPF to characterize the instrument.  While the calibration set has evolved with time, but is now mostly fixed (the table below is current as of October 2023).  This set of calibrations is designed to be sufficient for regular DRP processing without 'manual' calibrations taken by KPF observers.

Ca H & K Spectrometer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ca H & K spectrometer shares several calibration exposures with the main spectrometer.  The full set is listed below.

Dark    autocal-dark                 1200             5        the same exposures as for the main spectrometer (above)
Bias    autocal-bias                 0                22       the same exposures as for the main spectrometer (above)

======  ===========================  ===============  =======  ==================

Exposure Meter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Processing data from KPF's Exposure Meter (EM) is handled in real-time with a separate pipeline.  For documentation proposes, the table below lists the EM calibrations.  Note that because of coatings on optics in the Fiber Injection Unit that are specific to the light path for calibrations, most calibrations of that type do not deliver measurable flux to the Ca H&K Spectrometer.

Master Files
------------

For the main spectrometer, master files for bias, dark, flat, and the wavelength calibration sources listed above are created each day from the calibrations during the UT date.  The co-addition process involves iterative outlier rejection per pixel.  


How To Run Master WLS Pipeline
------------------------------

The following instructions cover how to run the Master WLS Pipeline for a given observation date.  Assume that date is 20230601 as an example.   The effect will be to remove all old \*master_WLS\* files in the canonical location of the master files (/data/kpf/masters/20230601/\*master_WLS\*) and replace them with \*master_WLS\* files generated by the current software version.  In the end, the CalFiles table in the operations database will be purged of all records for the observation date of interest, and then all master files in the canonical location will be re-registered as new records in the CalFiles table.  It is essential that the MD5 checksum of each master file matches the database record; otherwise the KPF DRP software, which utilizes master files, when connected to the operations database, will fail (but it will not care about the MD5 checksums if it is not connected to the operations database).

The basic steps are as follows.

1. Set up a private sandbox::

    mkdir -p /data/user/rlaher/sbx_test
    mkdir -p /data/user/rlaher/sbx_test/reference_fits/
    cd /data/user/rlaher/sbx_test/reference_fits/
    cp -p /data/kpf/reference_fits/* .

2. Set up the environment to point to the sandbox location (must be done via the ~/.bash_profile file, since it is sourced by bash script)::

    cd ~/git/KPF-Pipeline/cronjobs
    vi ~/.bash_profile
    export KPFCRONJOB_SBX=/data/user/rlaher/sbx_test
    source ~/.bash_profile
    printenv | grep SBX

3. Generate a run script for the observation date(s) of interest, in which the input parameters are start and end date.  This generates a script called runWLSPipelineFrom20230601To20230601.sh::

    cd ~/git/KPF-Pipeline/cronjobs
    perl generateWLSScriptBetweenTwoDates.pl 20230601 20230601

4. Run the Master WLS Pipeline::

    cd ~/git/KPF-Pipeline/cronjobs
    ./runWLSPipelineFrom20230601To20230601.sh

That's all there is to it!  The instructions for running the full Master Pipeline, which generates master bias, master dark, master flat, master arclamps, and master WLS files, will be slightly different from above, but these instructions have not yet been written.
