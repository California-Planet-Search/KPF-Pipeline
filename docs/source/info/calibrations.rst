KPF Calibrations:
=================

Add a list of the standard calibrations taken at WMKO on a daily basis and any on a less regular basis.  
These should include the more obvious bias, darks, flats, LFC, etalon, and ThAr for the main spectrometer 
as well as calibrations for the Ca H&K spectrometer, exposure meter (and anything else?)
