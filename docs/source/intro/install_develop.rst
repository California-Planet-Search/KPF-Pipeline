Installing from Develop or Feature Branches
===========================================

The ``master`` branch is considered the most stable (i.e less likely to
run into a bug), but it may not be the most up-to-date. As the pipeline is
developed, you may want to install the pipeline from ``develop`` branch
or some feature branch intead.

As before, clone the repository and navigate into it::

    git clone https://github.com/California-Planet-Search/KPF-Pipeline.git
    cd KPF-Pipeline

Then switch to the ``develop`` branch::

    git checkout develop

Now continue where you left off in the normal install process: :doc:`start`.
