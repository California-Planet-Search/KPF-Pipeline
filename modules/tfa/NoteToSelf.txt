Modifications

Suggestions:
1. use typing when defining python functions (PEP-484)
2. make recipe and config files mandatory input argument for command lines
3. now that we are using git flow, keep a release branch to keep track of all
our working, bug-free, demo-worthy commits
4. install from source into virtual enviroment (if not cloning from release branch)
