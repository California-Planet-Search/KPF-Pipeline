Thoughts: 
1. framework provides some good guideline for how our modules should be 
implemented, but since our pipeline require alot more complexity than the 
framework allows (recipes and more complicated primitives), we might have 
to overwrite parts of the framework (like event tables)
2. Kinda ambiguous on how parallelization can be achieved. 
3. 



Modifications
1. added a makefile for project management conveniences 
2. added a folder "modules" which hopefully contains all modules

Suggestions:
1. use typing when defining python functions (PEP-484)
2. make recipe and config files mandatory input argument for command lines
3. now that we are using git flow, keep a release branch to keep track of all
our working, bug-free, demo-worthy commits
4. install from source into virtual enviroment (if not cloning from release branch)
