1. Better error handling: 
	- when reading the config file, make sure that the manditory 
	variables are actually there before proceeding with the framework
	- have default configuration such that when no entry was detected 
	in the config file, the default is used and a warning is logged 
2. Better inline documentation: 
	- in try/except statements, explain what some of the errors
	it's catchig and why these errors might happen, and why they 
	are handled like that.
