This is central list of goals and TODOs for the wavelength calibration and inst 
drift modules. Notes are at the bottom. 

Long-term:
1. Make a database rather than saving individual intermediate files
2. Try a 2d polynomial (second dimension across orders))
3. Option to return spline instead of polynomial, with node at every LFC peak
4. Implement excalibur & test follow-up methods:
 - Directly model image as a linear combo of past images, rather than computing 
   peaks then computing principle components?
 - Full Bayesian method?
 - Test others
5. Think more about pixel PSF shape. Look at Dumusque paper about stitch boundaries.
6. Ideas for improving peak finding:
 - Use blaze information to more reliably find peaks
7. Compute autocorrelation of comb lines as a function of detector location to probe PSF
8. Make sure residuals are being calculated correctly (see Zhao+ eq 5)
9. Incorporate flux uncertainties in Gaussian fitting

NOTES:
1. KPF/NEID pixels span ~850 m/s, so the ThAr wls precision in one order should be below that.
2. Cuts to make when deciding on pared-down ThAr line list:
 - cut out blended or saturated lines
 - cut out Ar lines
 - intensity cut to remove shallowest lines
 - cut out lines that are consistently misfit
